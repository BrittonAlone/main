== Introduction

Tasketch is for those who need to manage their time by allocating time for each daily task. More importantly, Tasketch is optimized for those who prefer to use a desktop app and work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). +
This user guide is introducing the features of Tasketch and show to the users how to use all the command lines. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `tasketch.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here]*(the link needs to be changed)*.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Tasketch.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

*Command Format*

* Some commands have an alias, which you can also use to execute the command e.g. to add a task to Tasketch, you can
type either `clear` or `c`.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/TASK`, `TASK` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Do MA1101R tutorial`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `sd/START_DATE ed/END_DATE`, `ed/END_DATE sd/START_DATE` is also acceptable.
* The format for dates is `dd-mm-yy`. For example: `25-03-19` means March 25th, 2019.
* The format for times is `hh.mm` and it is using 24-hour clock. For example: `13.00` means 1 o'clock in the afternoon.

* If user type a string that is not a substring of any of the commands, then command line will show the most similar command compared this string.
* if user type a string can not match any command, then command line will show `No command matched`.
