== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to clear all tasks or clear tasks which start from one specific date or month, undo and redo the previous command*
** What it does: What it does: allows the user to exit the programme and to clear some tasks that are no longer needed on the daily basis or the monthly basis or even clear all tasks in the storage. Besides, it also allow users to undo and redo the previous command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make clear a branch of tasks in the app and recover form the previous command in case users have mad a mistake.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: the ability to open help window and to exit the program.
