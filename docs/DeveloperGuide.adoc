== Introduction
=== What is Tasketch

Tasketch is an application that helps you to manage your everyday time by giving you an overview of all the time planned
for all the tasks in a daily manner. It also helps you to be aware of all the tasks dateline too. +

This application is designed for the busy NUS students who have many tasks, assignments and datelines everyday. +

Tasketch uses minimal (GUI) elements, instead opting for a faster Command Line Interface (CLI) while maintaining the
benefits of the GUI. So, if you are used to the command line, Tasketch is sure to help manage your time effectively. +

This developer guide is introducing the development structure of Tasketch and provide a better understanding of how this project works. Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!


== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data and feedback to user so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `TaskBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Task Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Day>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Task Book`, which `Task` can reference. This would allow `Task Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Task` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Task Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Versioned Tasketch feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedTaskBook`.
It extends `TaskBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `taskBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedTaskBook#commit()` -- Saves the current task book state in its history.
* `VersionedTaskBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous task book state from its history.
* `VersionedTaskBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone task book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitTaskBook()`, `Model#undoTaskBook()` and `Model#redoTaskBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

*Step 1*: The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedTaskBook` will be initialized with the initial task book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single task book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

*Step 2*: The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the task book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitTaskBook()`, causing the modified state of the task book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `taskBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted task book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

*Step 3*: The user executes `add n/Do CS2113 ...` to add a new task. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitTaskBook()`, causing another modified task book state to be saved into the `taskBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitTaskBook()`, so the task book state will not be saved into the `taskBookStateList`.

*Step 4*: The user now decides that adding the task was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoTaskBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

*Step 5*: The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

*Step 6*: The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

//tag::autoComplete[]
=== Automatically complete input command feature

//end::autoComplete[]

// tag::wrongCommandSuggestion[]
=== Wrong Command Suggestion feature

The suggestions feature gives users helpful suggestions on what command to type, and corrections for commands when incorrect commands are being entered.

==== Current Implementation

When a user completes entering a command (after pressing ENTER key), if the command typed is invalid, the system will suggest a similar command based on the edit distance (which will be explained later).

Given below is an example usage of how the WrongCommandSuggestion behaves at each step.

*Step 1*: The user would type in the command string wrongly.

*Step 2*: The command would be parsed into the TaskBookParser class. Since no commands match the word exactly, it would fall into the default case.

*Step 3*: The default case would extract out only the command portion of the user input, and input it into the WrongCommandSuggestion class.

*Step 4*: WrongCommandSuggestion would first check the alphabets occurrence in the command word typed by users, if there is any correct command word has the same alphabets occurrence, WrongCommandSuggestion will return this command word immediately.

*Step 5*: Otherwise, WrongCommandSuggestion then would then instantiate the StringSimilarity class to find the nearest match of a word.

*Step 6*: editDistance in StringSimliarity class would be called to find out the edit distance between two words. These two words would be the wrong command the user has input, and the list of available commands in the whole application.

*Step 7*: WrongCommandSuggestion would then compare if the edit distance of the current command is shorter than the current shortest edit distance command (which is initialised to 3 edits). If it is shorter, it would then suggest the current command.

*Step 8*: WrongCommandSuggestion would then return the suggestion in a string, which would then be inputted into the CommandException, to be thrown to the LogicManager class.

==== Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1:** Compare the input command and the actual command character by character and see which command has the most matches.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Not as accurate or reliable in terms of giving a correct match of command.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a string matching algorithm to implement the matching and difference calculation between the command and the user input.
** Pros: Accurate prediction or suggestions from actual commands.
** Cons: Difficult to implement, and might require more processing overhead.
* **Alternative 3(current choice):** Combination of the two.
** Pros: More accurate prediction.
** Cons: More difficult to implement.

// end::wrongCommandSuggestion[]

// tag::reminder[]
=== Reminder feature
==== Current Implementation


// end::reminder[]

// tag::month/timeline[]
=== Effective Visualization feature

==== Current Implementation
There are mainly two parts in this features, **calendar** and **timeline arrangement**

These two parts will help the user better arrange their time usage by visualization of time.

* **There are currently two commands with parameters to help achieve this, `month` and `timeline`.**

** **Implementation for Calendar: ** Using `GridPane` to separate the whole calendar area into 35 grids.

*** Each one of the 35 grids is filled with PaneNode which is defined as area for a day.
*** PaneNode extends AnchorPane.

***

** **Implementation for Timeline:** Using javafx and segment each part of the browserPanel.

*** First, separate the whole `browserPanel` into 2 parts: `upperPane` and `timelinePane`.
*** Second, separate the `upperPane` into `calendarPane` and `reminderPane`.
*** The whole implementation of `timeline` is in `timelinePane` using javafx.
*** The overall structure is javafx VBox, which is a vertical arrangement structure.
*** Inside the VBox, there are key time points for interval of 2 hours. Then the timeline for each category.

// end::Effective Visualization[]

// tag::timeplanner[]
=== Daily Time Planner feature
Daily Time Planner uses the information of tasks added, such as start date, end date, start time, end time
and category.

==== Current Implementation
Start date and end date are used to identify whether the task added is a daily task, same dates mean that it is a daily
task or else it is a long term task which is not meant for daily time planning. Thus, that task will be added to
Daily Time Planner for monitoring. +

Start time and end time are used for calculating the time period of that task and to be added into the accumulated time
for a category for that date of a task. ( eg. if the task with date 13-03-19 is a category academic task, its calculated
time period will be added to the academic accumulated time in the day 13-03-19. )

These information is passed to the `calculateTime()` method in Day object in the form of string, so it has to be
converted to double data type for calculation purpose using `Double.valueOf()`. Then it has to be rounded up to the power
of 2 for consistency in data representation.

Besides `Task` model being used to represent all the tasks added, there is also `Day` model to represent all the days
which stores information (date and accumulated time of that 5 task categories) of the tasks added to that day.

[NOTE]
Each new `Task` added will not create new `Day` objects, instead it will either update the category times of that `Day`
if the new task added has the same date (same start date), or create a new `Day` only if there no days that have the same
date.

*Data Structure* +
`TaskBook` needs data structure to store data. Besides the ObservableList named `UniqueTaskList` to store all the tasks,
there is also another ObservableList named `UniqueDayList` to store all the days.

[NOTE]
Observable List is used to observe a list so that when there is change in the list, it will notified (listeners) all the other
components that utilizing this Observable List data and do the necessary updates in their own data.

Besides those 2 mentioned above, a HashMap named `dayMap` is used to store another set of `Day` objects which are
identical to the `UniqueDayList`.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): As described above**
** Pros: Faster in finding a `Day` object as it uses a key (start date of a task) to add into and find in the hash map.
** Cons: Double work as it needs to add into and remove the `Day` object from both `UniqueDayList` and `dayMap`.
* **Alternative 2: Using the `UniqueDayList` only**
** Pros: No extra work needed as adding and removing happens only to one data structure.
** Cons: Finding a `Day` object will be slower when there are large amount `Day` objects, as it needs to iterate through
the list.

However, `dayMap` cannot be implemented alone as it doesn't have the ability to observe and notified the listeners when
there is a change. So, it has to be implemented with an ObservableList.

[NOTE]
Since a new `TaskBook` is created each time `undo` and `redo` command executed as `VersionedTaskBook` extends `TaskBook`,
the data of the latest `UniqueTaskList` and `UniqueDayList` will need to transferred to the new `TaskBook` through
`resetData(ReadOnlyTaskBook newData)`.

[NOTE]
`dayMap` will be a reinitialised to new `HashMap` as the data in `UniqueDayList` is inaccurate during `resetData(ReadOnlyTaskBook newData)`.
So, it is better to start in clean state and re-add all the time period of all tasks in the `UniqueTaskList`. The
`UniqueDayList` will be updated as well.

// end::timeplanner[]

// tag::import/export[]
=== Import/Export feature

==== Current Implementation

===== Import
This operation is exposed in the Model interface as `Model#importTaskBook()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the export mechanism behaves at each step.

*Step 1*: The user calls the import command.

*Step 2*: The LogicManager calls parseCommand with the user input.

*Step 3*: The TaskBookParser is called and it returns a ImportCommand object to LogicManager.

*Step 4*: The LogicManager calls execute() on the ImportCommand object

*Step 5*: The Logic component then interacts with the Model component by calling `Model#importTasksFromTaskBook()`.

*Step 6*: The Model interface creates a new Import object and then pass the filePath to the ImportManager.

*Step 7*: The ModelManager will call `Import#readTaskBook()` and get a ReadOnlyTaskBook object.

[NOTE]
====
The ImportManager class will first check whether the task in the file exists in Tasketch, if there is an existing task, just ignore this task.
====


*Step 8*: The ModelManager will then will call `addTasksToTaskBook()`.

*Step 9*: If there is any new task added, the ModelManager will then call `Model#updateFilteredTaskList()` .

===== Export

This operation is exposed in the Model interface as `Model#exportTaskBook()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the export mechanism behaves at each step.

*Step 1*: The user calls the export command.

*Step 2*: The LogicManager calls parseCommand with the user input.

*Step 3*: The TaskBookParser is called and it returns a ExportCommand object to LogicManager.

*Step 4*: The LogicManager calls execute() on the ExportCommand object

*Step 5*: The Logic component then interacts with the Model component by calling `Model#exportFilteredTaskBook()` of the Model interface.

*Step 6*: The Model interface creates a new Export object and then pass the filteredTaskList and the filePath to the ExportManager.

*Step 7*: The Export object calls `Export#saveFilteredTasks()`.

*Step 8*: The ExportManager class will call `JsonFileStorage#saveDataToFile()`.

*Step 9*: The JsonFileStorage class will call `JsonUtil#saveJsonFile()`.

*Step 10*: The JsonUtil class will call `FileUtil#writeToFile()`.

*Step 11*: The FileUtil class will finally call `File#write()`.

[NOTE]
====
This File object will creates a new file if there is no existing file with the same name. And if there is an existing file, it will just write to this file no matter it is empty or not.
====

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Use what kind of file

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Json file**
** Pros: Easier to implement because the addressbook itself uses Json file to store the data.
** Cons: Hard for users to read about the exported file.
* **Alternative 2: Xml file**
** Pros: Xml is more widely used and it shows tha data better.
** Cons: Hard to implement.

// end::import/export[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* NUS students who need to manage time due to multiple CCAs, tasks, assignments and datelines
* Prefers typing over mouse input
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*:
Manage all the tasks and assignments by giving each of them a time period.
