== Introduction

Tasketch is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their daily tasks' schedule*. More importantly, Tasketch is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast,
Tasketch can get your tasks' schedule done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `tasketch.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here]*(the link needs to be changed)*.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Tasketch.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all the tasks you have added
* **`add`**`n/Do CS2113 sd/17-03-19 sd/10.00 ed/17-03-19 et/12.00 d/Do User Guide` : adds a new task to Tasketch.

type either `add ...` or `a ...`.
