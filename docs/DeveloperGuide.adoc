== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `TaskBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Task Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Task Book`, which `Task` can reference. This would allow `Task Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Task` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Task Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedTaskBook`.
It extends `TaskBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `taskBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedTaskBook#commit()` -- Saves the current task book state in its history.
* `VersionedTaskBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous task book state from its history.
* `VersionedTaskBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone task book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitTaskBook()`, `Model#undoTaskBook()` and `Model#redoTaskBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedTaskBook` will be initialized with the initial task book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single task book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the task book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitTaskBook()`, causing the modified state of the task book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `taskBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted task book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/Do CS2113 ...` to add a new task. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitTaskBook()`, causing another modified task book state to be saved into the `taskBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitTaskBook()`, so the task book state will not be saved into the `taskBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the task was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoTaskBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size
