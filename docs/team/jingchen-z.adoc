== PROJECT: Tasketch

== Overview

Tasketch is for those who need to manage their time by allocating time for each daily task. More importantly, Tasketch is optimized for those who prefer to use a desktop app and work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). +
This user guide is introducing the features of Tasketch and show to the users how to use all the command lines. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
