== Introduction

Tasketch is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their time by allocating time for each daily task. More importantly, Tasketch is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast,
Tasketch can get your tasks' schedule done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `tasketch.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here]*(the link needs to be changed)*.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Tasketch.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all the tasks you have added
* **`add`**`n/Do CS2113 sd/17-03-19 sd/10.00 ed/17-03-19 et/12.00 d/Do User Guide` : adds a new task to Tasketch.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the task with index 3 in Tasketch.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

* Some commands have an alias, which you can also use to execute the command e.g. to add a task to Tasketch, you can
type either `add ...` or `a ...`.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/TASK`, `TASK` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Do MA1101R tutorial`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `sd/START_DATE ed/END_DATE`, `ed/END_DATE sd/START_DATE` is also acceptable.
